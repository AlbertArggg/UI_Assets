# CREATE FILES - Editor Window V-1.0.1
### Auto Namespace Generator Updates
In this update, we have significantly improved how namespaces are generated from directory paths to avoid conflicts with existing class names within the Unity environment and .NET Framework. These enhancements ensure that the automatic namespacing functionality is more robust and less likely to create issues during project compilation.

- **Dynamic Type Checking:** Introduced a method to dynamically check if a namespace part conflicts with any known class names across all currently loaded assemblies. This prevents the accidental creation of namespaces that could interfere with system and Unity class names.

- **Conflict Resolution Dictionary:** Implemented a `Dictionary<string, string>` named `KNOWN_NAMESPACE_CONFLICTS` that maps potential conflicting directory names to alternative namespace parts. This preemptive measure addresses common conflicts directly, providing a first layer of defense against naming issues.

- **Namespace Part Adjustment:** For directory names that still pose a conflict after the initial dictionary check, we've updated the namespace generation logic to append a suffix `Ns` to the conflicting part, ensuring uniqueness.

### Enhanced JSON to C# Class Generation
We're excited to announce the latest update to our JSON to C# class generator within the CREATE FILES Editor Window. Version 1.0.1 introduces the highly requested features for dynamically managing C# classes and fields directly from JSON data. This update significantly streamlines the process of converting JSON into structured C# classes, providing developers with more flexibility and control over their data models.

- **Dynamic Class and Field Management:** Developers can now effortlessly add new classes and remove existing ones from the JSON data structure. This dynamic interaction extends to the fields within each class, allowing for a fully customizable approach to defining your data models.

- **Improved User Interface:** The Editor Window has been refined to include intuitive options for adding and removing both classes and fields. With just a click, users can insert a new class or field, or remove unwanted ones, making the management of your data structure more accessible than ever.

- **Class Name Changes:** Changing the class name in any Data Object will be reflected in other Data Object's field types.
